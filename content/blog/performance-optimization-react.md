# React Performance Optimization: Beyond useMemo and useCallback

While `useMemo` and `useCallback` are essential tools, true React performance optimization requires a deeper understanding of rendering behavior and advanced techniques.

## Understanding React's Rendering Behavior

Before optimizing, you need to understand when and why components re-render:

```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>
        Count: {count}
      </button>
      <ChildComponent user={user} />
    </div>
  );
}

// ChildComponent will re-render every time ParentComponent re-renders,
// even if the user object hasn't changed!
function ChildComponent({ user }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered'); // This logs on every click
  return <div>Hello, {user.name}</div>;
}

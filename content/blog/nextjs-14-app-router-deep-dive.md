# Next.js 14 App Router: A Complete Deep Dive

The App Router in Next.js 14 represents a fundamental shift in how we build React applications. With server components, streaming, and enhanced routing capabilities, it's time to upgrade your mental model.

## Server Components vs Client Components

### Server Components (Default)
Server components run on the server and have zero bundle impact on the client. They're perfect for data fetching, accessing backend resources, and keeping sensitive information on the server.

```jsx
// app/products/page.js - Server Component
async function ProductsPage() {
  // This runs on the server
  const products = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`
    },
    cache: 'force-cache' // Static generation
  }).then(res => res.json());

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <ProductsList products={products} />
    </div>
  );
}

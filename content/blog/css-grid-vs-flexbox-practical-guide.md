# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: A Practical Guide for 2024

Understanding when to use CSS Grid versus Flexbox is crucial for creating modern, responsive layouts. Both are powerful tools, but they serve different purposes.

## The Fundamental Difference

**Flexbox** is designed for one-dimensional layouts - either a row OR a column.

**CSS Grid** is designed for two-dimensional layouts - both rows AND columns simultaneously.

## When to Use Flexbox

### 1. Navigation Menus
Flexbox is perfect for horizontal navigation where items need to be spaced evenly or aligned properly.

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  background: #333;
}

.nav-links {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2rem;
  list-style: none;
}

.nav-links a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 0.3s;
}

.nav-links a:hover {
  color: #4ade80;
}

# Modern React Patterns You Should Know in 2024

React has evolved significantly over the years, and with the introduction of hooks and concurrent features, new patterns have emerged that can dramatically improve your code quality and developer experience.

## Compound Components

Compound components allow you to create more flexible and expressive APIs for your components. Instead of passing everything through props, you can use context to share state between related components.

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const TabsContext = createContext();

export function Tabs({ children, defaultIndex = 0 }) {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(defaultIndex);
  
  return (
    <TabsContext.Provider value={{ activeIndex, setActiveIndex }}>
      <div className="tabs">{children}</div>
    </TabsContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function TabsList({ children }) {
  return <div className="tabs-list">{children}</div>;
}

export function TabsTrigger({ index, children }) {
  const { activeIndex, setActiveIndex } = useContext(TabsContext);
  
  return (
    <button
      className={activeIndex === index ? 'active' : ''}
      onClick={() => setActiveIndex(index)}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export function TabsContent({ index, children }) {
  const { activeIndex } = useContext(TabsContext);
  
  return activeIndex === index ? <div>{children}</div> : null;
}

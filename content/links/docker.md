Docker revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications. Create consistent development environments, streamline deployments, and ensure your applications run the same way everywhere. Essential for modern DevOps, microservices architecture, and eliminating "it works on my machine" problems. The documentation is excellent for learning containerization concepts and best practices.

# React for Absolute Beginners

## What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It lets you create reusable UI components.

## Key Concepts You'll Learn:

### 1. JSX Syntax
JSX is a syntax extension that looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

## 2. Components
Components are the building blocks of React applications:

```
function Button() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}

## 3. Props
Props allow you to pass data to components:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

## 4. State
State lets components remember information:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
